# # Eye-controlled-cursor
The Eye-Controlled Cursor and Dashboard project addresses the critical need for accessible computer interaction methods for individuals facing mobility challenges. This project seeks to empower people with limited mobility, including those in a vegetative state or individuals who have undergone medical procedures restricting their physical movements, by harnessing the power of eye-tracking technology. The fundamental objective is to create a user-friendly interface that allows seamless interaction with computers solely through eye movements, thereby enhancing independence and facilitating communication and task completion.
